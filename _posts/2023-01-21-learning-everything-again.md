As a software engineer, it's easy to get caught up in details. After all, programming itself is a very detail-oriented skill. One skill that I've needed to develop in addition to just coding is documentation and writing.

The problem is that it's also easy for me to get side-tracked from the entire point of an exercise. In this particular case, I'm talking about creating a blog or website. In previous iterations of creating a website, I got intrigued by the technologies that were used to create or generate the website. As an engineer, I'm can easily learn to do the front-end development (i.e.  writing HTML, CSS, Javascript) in order to create a very minimal and pretty website.

The main intention though is to write content. I'm self-aware of what I'm doing, and that building the website (versus writing content) is clearly not my overall intention. I fool myself by thinking that if only I build a very minimal and sleek website, then I can *really* focus on the content. Let me just tweak these few things before I start writing.

Unfortunately, by the time I'm done tweaking, my motivation is also sapped. Time to move on to the next thing. Gotta focus on work or classes or personal life again. Sometimes I have bursts of motivation so I'm still able to write some content too, and that's what I ended up on my previous blog iterations. But I can only wonder how much more or how much longer my writing stint would've lasted if I focused on writing rather than coding.

So this time around, I'm coming back to using Jekyll and hosting it on GitHub Pages. It's the path of least resistance. Rather than spending time and energy figuring out free, but custom hosting options that also let me keep my source code private, I decide to to fork over the $4/month for get a GitHub Pro plan, which lets me host on GitHub Pages while keeping my repo private.
