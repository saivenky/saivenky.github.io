I've spent years trying to find that "one simple program"---from CrossFit classes that cost a fortune to to running streaks that left my knees barely functioning. I even tried powerlifting plans that left me with overuse aches all while skipping cardio.

What I finally found allows me to be fit and healthy enough to chase my toddler and strong enough to carry them while unloading groceries. A program with **two compound lifts, super simple cardio, and flexible rest days that prioritized recovery.** This is the hybrid fitness framework that works for me as a software engineer and parent. It's not flashy, but it's effective.

## Why This Framework Works for a Dev-Dad Schedule

- **Short sessions** --- 2 lifts per day \--> I'm in and out of the gym in <45 min. On busy gym days where the
- **Built-in, flexible recovery** --- Upper \--> Lower \--> Rest micro-cycle gives ~72 hr before the same muscle is hit again (and you can always add an extra rest day when things feel achy).
- **Gentle, simple cardio** --- No need to pump myself up before cardio anymore. NEAT/LISS burns calories without post-run hunger or brain fog that ruins deep-work blocks. It also saves time since I'm not coming back drenched in sweat and needing a shower.

**Glossary:**
>- **NEAT** = every calorie burned outside formal exercise (e.g. steps, typing on the keyboard).
>- **LISS** = steady cardio <65% HRmax (e.g. incline walk, ruck). Almost an opposite of HIIT.
>- **Upper-Lower Split** = alternating upper body and lower body training sessions with at least one rest day after hitting both.

## Why Other Popular Approaches Didn't Stick

| Method | What I Liked | Deal-Breakers (for me) | Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CrossFit WODs and Metcons** | Big calorie burn, infectious vibe | $150+/mo box fees; awkward to DIY in a commercial gym; HIIT hunger spikes | Intensity is fun, but it's hard to DIY and hits the wallet otherwise. |
| **Powerlifting (the "Big 3")** | Easy-to-track strength metrics | Aches without accessories lifts and mobility work; Never _looks_ like I lift | Heavy compound lifts improves strength, but needs variety per muscle group. |
| **Running** | Cheap, outdoors, meditative | Knee pain creeps in within a week; hunger & brain fog when mileage gets high | Incline walks & stroller rucks---same burn, zero ache. |
| **Bike / Row Erg** | Easy to grind, no joint impact, and weather-friendly | Still prone to overuse aches; grinds at joints in a different way | Not my cornerstone, but a good backup. |

In short, these all left me with long-term stress on joints, time, and/or hunger. Nowadays if I have lower back pain, I know it's because of my bad posture at my desk chair and not the workouts I'm doing.
