When you have a busy schedule or a family to care for, gathering the willpower to do cardio can be a challenge. But what if you could make it so easy that you don't even have to think about it? That's the goal of this post: to show you how to integrate cardio into your daily routine without it feeling like a chore.

## What I Tried First

### Baseline Steps

Some mornings I barely have time to brush my teeth and you're telling me I should schedule a run too? When I created this routine, I wanted to make it as easy and simple as possible while helping me reach my fat-loss goal. Increasing my steps (NEAT) was the first step (pun intended).

> Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) is the energy expended for everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. This includes walking, cleaning, and even fidgeting. By increasing our NEAT, we can burn more calories without dedicating extra time to structured cardio.

I used my moving average body weight as the feedback loop.
- If weight was going down at the correct rate, I would keep my steps the same.
- If weight was going down too fast, I would reduce my steps by 500.
- If weight was going down too slow (or I was gaining weight), I would increase my steps by 500.

### Adding LISS

Once I hit 8,000 steps a day, I realized any more steps were not going to be sustainable. It took me ~1 minute for 100 steps. So 8,000 steps took me nearly 1.5 hours (sprinkled throughout the day). But the benefit-to-effort ratio was diminishing. This is why I also added LISS to my routine.

> Low-Intensity Steady State (LISS) cardio is a form of exercise that is performed at a low intensity for an extended period of time. It can be done in various forms, such as walking, cycling, or swimming. LISS is effective for fat loss because it allows you to burn calories without the high impact and stress on your joints that comes with high-intensity workouts.

But unlike NEAT, I treated LISS as a separate activity. I put on my gym clothes and hopped on the treadmill or stationary bike. It was more efficient for calorie burn, but it required additional overhead time: changing into gym clothes, possibly driving to the gym, and showering afterward.

## Why This Failed

For the majority of my fat-loss phase, I kept needing to increase steps and add more LISS. It got to the point where I simply skipped LISS because the time commitment was too high. And adding more steps was also hard to squeeze in.


## Key Lesson --- Incremental Cardio Wins

Even though my adherence was falling, incrementing my step count target slowly actually worked (at least for a while). Before starting this routine, I was averaging 4,000 steps or less a day. By the end, I was averaging 8,000 steps a day. This was a huge win for me.

## Cardio Routine

Here's what I recommend now that I've gone through the process and learned from my mistakes:

1. Establish a baseline of 4,000 steps per day.
2. Increase your step count by 500 steps every week until you hit 8,000 steps per day.

Congrats. You've established your baseline NEAT. Now you experiment.

### Experimentation Phase

For fat loss and joint-friendly cardio:

| Cardio Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Incline Walk | Walk on a treadmill at 12% incline at >2 mph. |
| Stationary Bike | Cycle at a steady pace while watching Netflix or listening to music. |
| Ruck | Walk with a weighted backpack or stroller. |
| Rowing Erg | Row at a steady pace while watching Netflix or listening to music. |
| Kettlebell Swings | Perform kettlebell swings at a steady pace. |

Start slow and ramp up the time and intensity. I already failed to follow my own advice with both rucking and rowing. I set targets that were too aggressive and ended up with knee pain that took my out of regular training for 3 days.
