When you have a busy schedule or a family to care for, gathering the willpower to do cardio can be a challenge. But what if you could make it so easy that you don't even have to think about it? That's the goal of this post: to show you how to integrate cardio into your daily routine without it feeling like a chore.

## What I Tried First

### Baseline Steps

Some mornings I barely have time to brush my teeth and you're telling me I should schedule a run too? When I created this routine, I wanted to make it as easy and simple as possible while helping me reach my fat-loss goal. Increasing my steps (NEAT) was the first step (pun intended).

> Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) is the energy expended for everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. This includes walking, cleaning, and even fidgeting. By increasing our NEAT, we can burn more calories without dedicating extra time to structured cardio.

I used my moving average body weight as the feedback loop.

| If my weight was... | Then I would... |
| --- | --- |
| Going down at the correct rate | Keep my steps the same |
| Going down too fast | Reduce my steps by 500 |
| Going down too slow (or gaining weight) | Increase my steps by 500 |

### Adding LISS

Once I hit 8,000 steps a day, I realized any more steps was not sustainable. It took me ~1 minute for 100 steps. So 8,000 steps took me nearly 1.5 hours (sprinkled throughout the day). But the **benefit-to-effort ratio of NEAT was diminishing**. This is why I added LISS to my routine.

> Low-Intensity Steady State (LISS) cardio is like the opposite of HIIT (high-intensity interval training). And exactly like it sounds --- cardio that is at an easy pace for an extended period of time. LISS is effective for fat loss because it allows you to burn calories without stress on your joints that comes with high-intensity workouts.

And I don't know about you, but I usually get really hungry after a long run or HIIT workout. LISS doesn't do that to me.

Unlike NEAT, I treated LISS as a separate activity. It was more efficient for calorie burn, but it **requires additional overhead time**: changing into gym clothes, possibly driving to the gym, and showering afterward.

### Why This Failed

For the majority of my fat-loss phase, I kept needing to increase steps and add more LISS. It got to the point where I simply skipped LISS because the **time committment became too high**. And adding more steps was also hard to squeeze in.


### Takeaway --- Incremental Cardio Wins

Even though my adherence was falling, **layering on more steps slowly actually stuck** (for much longer than I thought it would). Before starting this routine, I was averaging 4,000 steps or less a day. By the end, I was averaging 8,000 steps a day. This was a huge win for me.

## An Engineer's Framework for Adding Cardio

### Establishing the Baseline

Here's what I recommend now that I've gone through this process and learned from my mistakes:

1. Establish a baseline of 4,000 steps per day. If that's still too high, just figure out where you are currently at and just start there.
2. Increase your step count by 500 steps every 3 days until you hit 8,000 steps per day. Walking the extra steps for 3 days helps let the routine settle in. But keep pushing forward. Needing to do an extra 1000 or 2000 steps since the baseline made me realize that an extra 500 wasn't so bad.

Even if you're not trying to lose weight, this is a good baseline for cardio. It will help you stay mobile and keep your joints healthy.

Congrats. You've established your baseline NEAT. Now you experiment.

### Experimenting with More Cardio

Since I determined NEAT wasn't enough, the final step is finding the extra cardio that works. For this, it really depends on your preferences and what you can stick with.

Here are some that I am experimenting with. As I try them, I'm planning on posting updates on how they worked for me, how to get startd with each quickly, and how to adapt them into your own routine.

| Cardio Type | Why? |
| --- | --- |
| Incline Walk | All you need is a treadmill. I'm already getting my steps in. Why not literally ramp up the intensity? |
| Ruck | Once again, this is an easy upgrade to getting daily steps in. I can just throw on a backpack with weights. |
| Kettlebell Swings | Very minimalist needs for equipment, which also improves your posture and strength. |
| Rowing Erg | Cardio that also involves your upper body, which helps build a balanced physique. |
| Stationary Bike | I used to bike a lot to commute. Plus it feels easier than running. |
