I believe that simplicity helps you stay consistent. In this post I'll go over the exact 7-day training template for my full hybrid fitness program. The entire focus of which is to help busy software engineers and parents maintain a fitness program that works for them.

## What *is* a Microcycle?

Before we dive into the details, a microcycle is a **short training block** that typically lasts 5--14 days. It's the foundation of a larger training plan. Think of it as a smallest repeatable template that you follow.

## Baseline Loop (3-Day)

As I mentioned in the [Upper-Lower Strength Plan]({% post_url 2025-06-05-upper-lower-two-lift-strength-template %}), the baseline is a 3-day loop of:
- Upper body strength
- Lower body strength
- Rest day

But that's not exactly the full picture. In order to target all the muscles and joint or muscle imbalances, I add some variations to the upper body lifts, which is why I have two upper body days:
- **Upper (V)**: Vertical plane focus (e.g. incline press, lat pull-down)
- **Upper (H)**: Horizontal plane focus (e.g. chest press, mid-row)

## One Week Snapshot

> **Note:** The table below doesn't mention to do baseline cardio --- it assumes you're already doing 8,000 steps per day. Start at 4,000 steps per day and work up to 8,000 and then maintain that. See the [Cardio Layering]({% post_url 2025-06-17-cardio-layering %}) post for how to ramp up to this.

| Day | Strength | Cardio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mon (Day 1) | **Upper (V)**: Incline press, lat pull-down | - |
| Tue (Day 2) | **Lower**: Angled leg press, prone leg curl | *Optional: Specialized cardio* |
| Wed (Day 3) | *Rest* | - |
| Thu (Day 4) | **Upper (H)**: Chest press, mid-row | - |
| Fri (Day 5) | **Lower**: Angled leg press, prone leg curl | *Optional: Specialized cardio* |
| Sat (Day 6) | *Rest* | *(Optional) Extra steps* |
| Sun (Day 7) | *Rest* | *(Optional) Extra steps* |

## Tips and Explanations

- Try to **walk extra steps on the weekends**, especially on rest days happening on the weekend. If you go out and do stuff, this will naturally happen.
- Specialized cardio happens on Lower days because most cardio uses the lower body, so this **cardio helps circulate blood and help recovery**.
- **Specialized cardio helps break the monotony of just walking** but is completely optional. It's only sprinkled in to avoid too much extra fatigue from the extra cardio.
- **If you want more strength training**, see the asynchronous loop option in the [Upper-Lower Strength Plan]({% post_url 2025-06-05-upper-lower-two-lift-strength-template %}) post.
- Follow the recommended rest days to avoid getting hurt and having enough recovery. **Your body grows muscle during rest, not during the workout.**
