I always try to play catch-up when I restart journaling. I often end up not journaling at all because I feel compelled to journal each day that I'd forgotten to journal.

When that's a couple days, it's not so bad. But when it's weeks or months, all of a sudden, the task of recording my feelings ends up becoming detective work: looking through Google Calendar or my location timeline to figure out what I was doing on days in the past.

Ever since I realized this issue, I've tried to not play catch-up. I just write mostly about what I remember. If I do play catch-up, it's only based on my current memory. If I don't remember, it probably wasn't a big enough thing in my life to write down / note down anyways.
