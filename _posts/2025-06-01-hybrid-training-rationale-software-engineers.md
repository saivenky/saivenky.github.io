You've probably flirted with CrossFit boxes, 5k running streaks, or powerbuilding spreadsheets—only to watch your elbows, knees, or appetite rebel. This post lays out *why* the minimalist **upper-lower + NEAT** formula became my forever base after every other experiment sparked injury or brain-fog.

TL;DR If you spend eight hours at a keyboard and two chasing a toddler, you need a program that respects joints, attention span, and appetite. Hybrid training = heavy lifts + low-gear cardio.

## Why This Framework Works for a Dev-Dad Schedule

- **Compact sessions:** Two big lifts per day keep gym time ≲45 min.
- **Recovery baked-in:** Upper → Lower → Rest micro-cycles give joints ≈72h between repeats and leave space for an extra rest when life hits.
- **Brain-friendly cardio:** NEAT/LISS burns calories without the hunger spikes or post-WOD brain fog that sabotage deep-focus blocks.

**Glossary:**
>- **NEAT** = every calorie burned outside formal exercise (e.g. steps, stroller pushes).
>- **LISS** = steady cardio ≤65% HRmax (e.g. incline walk, ruck).
>- **Upper-Lower Split** = alternating upper body and lower body training sessions with at least one rest day after each Lower

## Why Other Popular Approaches Didn't Stick

These experiments showed me that **simplicity, joint-friendliness, and appetite control** matter more than raw calorie burn.

| Method | What I Liked | Deal-Breakers (for me) | Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CrossFit-style WODs** | Big calorie burn; community energy | Box fees are $100+/month; awkward in commercial gym; post-HIIT hunger pangs | Fun but unsustainable for my wallet & appetite |
| **"Big 3" Powerlifting** | Simple metric-driven strength | Overuse aches minus accessories; sessions > 60 min | I kept the heavy compounds, ditched long accessory lists |
| **Regular Running** | Cheap; outdoors | Knee pain; hunger & fog past 5k | Swapped distance for incline walking & rucks |
| **Bike / Erg** | Joint-friendly; weather-proof | Extra equipment only at gym; hard to stay consistent | Reserved as rainy-day backup |
