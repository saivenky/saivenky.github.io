I spent years chasing the **one simple program**—CrossFit classes that cost a fortune and left my elbows cranky, running streaks that fired up my knees, power-building plans that ballooned with accessory work yet skipped cardio.

What finally stuck is simpler still: **two compound lifts, one low-gear cardio target, and a rest day whenever life—or joints—demand it.** No class fees, no mileage charts, no sprawling spreadsheets—just an upper-lower split plus NEAT/LISS that keeps joints happy, hunger tame, and strength climbing.

## Why This Framework Works for a Dev-Dad Schedule

- **Compact sessions** – Two compound lifts per day → Out of the gym in ≲ 45 min.
- **Built-in recovery** – Upper → Lower → Rest micro-cycle gives ~72 h before the same tissue is hit again (and you can always drop an extra rest day when life hits).
- **Brain-friendly cardio** – NEAT/LISS burns calories without the hunger spikes or post-WOD haze that ruin deep-work blocks.

**Glossary:**
>- **NEAT** = every calorie burned outside formal exercise (e.g. steps, stroller pushes).
>- **LISS** = steady cardio ≤65% HRmax (e.g. incline walk, ruck).
>- **Upper-Lower Split** = alternating upper body and lower body training sessions with at least one rest day after each lower body session.

## Why Other Popular Approaches Didn't Stick

| Method | What I Liked | Deal-Breakers (for me) | Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CrossFit-style WODs** | Big calorie burn, infectious vibe | $150+/mo box fees; awkward to DIY in a commercial gym; HIIT hunger spikes | Intensity is fun, but only if it doesn't eat my lunch (literally). |
| **“Big 3” Powerlifting** | Simple, objective strength markers | Overuse aches without accessories; sessions creep past 60 min | Heavy compounds are gold; accessory overload is tin. |
| **Regular Running** | Cheap, outdoors, meditative | Knee pain by week 3; hunger & fog when mileage > 5 km | Swapped mileage for incline walks & stroller rucks—same burn, zero ache. |
| **Bike / Row Erg** | Joint-friendly, weather-proof | Requires gym slot or extra kit; novelty fades | Great rainy-day backup, not my cornerstone. |

High-intensity or high-volume methods delivered short-term thrills **but** long-term friction on joints, schedule, and satiety. Now if I have lower back pain, I know it's beacuse of my bad posture at my desk chair and not the workouts I'm doing. I know that my The hybrid formula is boring on paper—and that's why I still do it.
