## Why I Paused Bouldering  
For almost ten years, bouldering was my sport of choice. Solving movement puzzles on the wall kept me engaged. After becoming a parent, however, three-hour climbing sessions and long rest periods no longer fit my schedule.

## New Priorities  
- **Strength relative to body-weight** — stay light, move well  
- **Visible muscle** — look like I train without living at the gym  
- **Low injury risk** — stay active with my child, not in rehab  
- **Minimal fatigue** — toddler care is tiring enough  
- **Time efficiency** — 45 minutes, door to door  

## Why an Upper-Lower Split Works  
Met-cons left me drained; power-lifting aggravated my knees; classic bro-splits trained each muscle too infrequently. An upper-lower arrangement provides frequent stimulation, simple exercise selection, and quick recovery.

## The 4-Day, 45-Minute Plan  

| Day | Focus | Core Lifts | Time |
|-----|-------|------------|------|
| **Mon** | Upper (horizontal) | Chest press · Mid-row | 45 min |
| **Tue** | Lower | Hamstring curl · Leg press | 45 min |
| **Wed** | Rest | Walking & mobility | — |
| **Thu** | Upper (vertical) | Incline press · Lat pulldown | 45 min |
| **Fri** | Lower | Leg press · Hamstring curl | 45 min |
| **Sat–Sun** | Family time | Parks, hikes, recovery | — |

If I want more or less rest, I simply rotate through **Upper → Lower → Rest**.

> Programming follows Dr. Mike Israetel’s hypertrophy guidelines—enough volume for growth, enough rest to stay fresh.

## What I’ll Track  
I have a DEXA scan scheduled for late May 2025 to capture lean mass, fat mass, and bone density. I’ll share those results once they’re in.
