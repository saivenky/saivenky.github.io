Between Slack pings and toddler shrieks, attention is your scarcest resource. This minimalist upper-lower routine strips out accessory noise, leaving high-signal sets that build strength in 45 minutes—no ego lifts, no wasted reps.

## Program Overview at a Glance

### Option A - Weekly‑Aligned

| Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Upper (V)** | **Lower** | **Rest** | **Upper (H)** | **Lower** | **Rest** | *Optional Rest / Family Day* |

### Option B — Asynchronous Loop

| Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Upper (V)** | **Lower** | **Rest** | **Upper (H)** | **Lower** | **Rest** | *Repeat* — insert **extra Rest** after any two full loops if joints feel cranky |

> **NEAT happens every day.** Dial steps up or down (± 500) based on the 5‑day moving‑average of body‑weight.

## Strength Block

**Session split & exercise menu**

| Day           | Primary Push                  | Primary Pull / Lower | Notes                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Upper (V)** | Machine *incline* chest press | Cable lat pull‑down  | Vertical plane focus    |
| **Upper (H)** | Machine chest press           | Machine mid‑row      | Horizontal plane focus  |
| **Lower**     | Angled leg press              | Prone ham curl       | Swap order each session |

### Warm-up protocol (per exercise)

1. **12 reps @ ∼30 % work weight** (RPE 4)
2. **8 reps @ ∼50 % work weight** (RPE 5‑6)
3. **4 reps @ ≈ 10RM load** (RPE 6‑7)

### Working sets

* **Start with 3 working sets per exercise.** Keep this number until you run two consecutive sessions with **no residual soreness or joint tenderness** by the next session.
* **Add a 4th and 5th set** only after those two "green‑light" sessions. If soreness returns, drop back down to 3 sets.
* **Rep target:** choose a load that lets you reach **≥ 7 technically clean reps** *before* the first honest failure rep.
* **Cluster-style pause‑rest:** when you hit failure, rack the weight, **rest 8-10 seconds**, perform a mini-set until failure again (hopefully at least 2 more reps), rest again, and finish one more burst to failure. The entire cluster counts as **one working set**.
* Stop the set as soon as form degrades or your mini-set is only 1 rep; log reps in each mini-set and the weight you used (e.g., `8,3,2@135`).
* Rest 1–3 min between working sets and record **top‑set reps** for progression decisions.

### Auto-regulated progression

* If best set beats last session’s reps by **≥ 2**, **increase load** next time (smallest jump possible).
* If reps stall 2× in a row, decrease load 5% and chase cleaner tempo.
* Insert the optional extra rest day whenever joints or CNS feel off.
