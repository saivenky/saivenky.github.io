Three months of *very doable* lifting plus low-intensity movement dropped my body-fat by **1.9%**, added **5.7 lb** of lean tissue, and didn’t require crash-diets, 5a.m. runs, or any other heroic measures.

## From Baseline to Check‑In

Back in late February I booked a baseline DEXA scan so I’d have more than scale weight to judge the fat‑loss block I was about to start. After 90 days of four‑day lifting, extra walking, and a modest calorie deficit, I stepped back into the scanner last week. Here’s what changed—and exactly how I got there.

In **[Dad Bod Debugging]({% post_url 2025-05-02-dad-bod-debugging %})** I promised to circle back after a DEXA scan. This is that follow-up: the numbers, the context, and what actually moved the needle.
## The DEXA Results


| Metric | 25 Feb 2025 | 4 June 2025 | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Body-fat % | 19.1% | **17.2%** | **-1.9%** |
| Lean mass | 122.7 lb | **128.4 lb** | **+5.7 lb** |
| Fat mass | 28.9 lb | **26.5 lb** | **-2.4 lb** |
| Total mass | 157.3 lb | **160.7 lb** | **+3.4 lb** |

## What the Training Actually Looked Like

* **Upper/Lower Two-Lift Template** — 4 sessions/week, 45 min each.
* **Movement between meetings** — averaging ~8k steps/day. When I missed my target I added a 15–20 min treadmill incline walk (still Zone 2, nothing crazy).
* **No running, HIIT, or circuits.** Just steady walking + lifting.
* **Recovery** — 2 colds (6 lifting days lost) and one short vacation; on those weeks I dropped volume by half or more and got back on track after I felt better.

_Total weekly time commitment: ~4 h lifting, ~2.5 h accumulated walking._

## Nutrition in One Paragraph

Maintenance calories or very slight deficit on most days. Protein 1 g/lb. No foods were off-limits; the guard-rails were portion size and adequate protein.

## Takeaways

1. **Body weight is only a proxy for real results.** A DEXA gave the feedback loop I needed.
2. **Consistency beats perfection.** Missing a few workouts wasn’t fatal; quitting would have been.
3. **Low-intensity movement adds up.** Steps + gentle incline walks handled cardio without wrecking joints or recovery.
4. **A minimal program still works.** Two compound lifts per session was enough stimulus once effort and progression were tracked.

## Debugging Common Myths

| Myth | Reality from this block |
| --- | --- |
| “You have to starve to see lose fat.” | Small deficit + adequate protein was enough to drop fat while gaining muscle. |
| “Endless HIIT is required.” | Walking and the occasional incline treadmill session covered the aerobic base. |
| “Busy schedule means no progress.” | < 6 hours/week total time investment moved all three metrics in the right direction. |

## What’s Next?

I’m switching to a **gentle surplus** for a dedicated muscle-gain phase. To keep the engine healthy without beating up my knees I’m experimenting with:

* **Rowing erg** — short, easy sessions after lifting. Initial tests show this may not work for me.
* **Rucking** — starting light and gradually adding load/time. I started too eager and my knees complained, so I’m dialing back my pace and weight.

I’ll run another DEXA mid-August and report back.
