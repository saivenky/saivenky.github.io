Three months of *minimalist* strength training plus *low-intensity* cardio **reduced my body-fat by 1.9%** and **added 5.7 lb of muscle**, and didn't require crash-diets, 5a.m. runs, or any other heroic measures.

## From Baseline to Check-In

Back in late February I booked a baseline DEXA scan so I could tell whether the fat-loss phase I was about to start was really going to work. After 90 days of **consistent lifting, extra walking, and a very modest (sometime non-existent) calorie deficit**, I stepped back into the scanner last week. Here's what changed and exactly how I got there.

## The DEXA Results


| Metric | 25 Feb 2025 | 4 June 2025 | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Body-fat % | 19.1% | 17.2% | **-1.9%** |
| Lean mass | 122.7 lb | 128.4 lb | **+5.7 lb** |
| Fat mass | 28.9 lb | 26.5 lb | **-2.4 lb** |
| Total mass | 157.3 lb | 160.7 lb | +3.4 lb |

_The total mass increase doesn't matter since it was all lean tissue._

## What the Training Actually Looked Like

* **Time-optimized upper/lower strength training** --- ~4 sessions/week, usually <45 min each.
* **"Barely-broke-a-sweat" cardio** --- averaging ~8k steps/day. When I needed more, I added a 15--20 min treadmill incline walk (still Zone 2, nothing crazy).
* **No running, HIIT, or circuits.** Only steady walking + lifting.
* **Recovery** --- 2 colds (6 lifting days lost) and one short vacation; on those weeks I dropped volume by half or more and got back on track after I felt better.

## Nutrition in One Paragraph

Maintenance calories or very slight deficit on most days. Protein 1 g/lb. No foods were off-limits; but I did use a **5-day moving average** to give me some feedback on my diet (while smoothing out daily fluctuations).

## Takeaways

1. **Body weight is only a proxy.** Only using a body weight scale would've told me a different story. One of failure --- I gained weight when I wanted to lose weight. A DEXA gave me the real story.
2. **Consistency beats perfection.** Missing a few workouts wasn't fatal; quitting would have been.
3. **Low-intensity movement adds up.** Steps + gentle incline walks handled cardio without wrecking joints or recovery.
4. **A minimal program still works.** Two compound lifts per session was enough stimulus as long as you push hard.

## Debugging Common Myths

| Myth | What I Realized |
| --- | --- |
| "You have to starve to lose fat." | A small deficit and adequate protein was enough to drop fat while gaining muscle. In fact, heavy dieting would have made me lose muscle too. |
| "You need to spend hours lifting to grow muscle." | Lift smarter, not harder. I made sure my time at the gym was efficient and optimized for muscle growth, not for my ego. |
| "Busy schedule means no gym time." | This has been the least time committment I've needed for a fitness routine. I was able to juggle my full-time job and toddler care without feeling overwhelmed. I was honestly surprised to see the numbers. |


## What's Next?

I am a bit skeptical of my results and perhaps I'm still getting "beginner gains". But because of how easy this program was to follow, I'm planning on **continuing for a muscle-gain phase**. The main difference will be switching to a **gentle calorie surplus** to keep recovery and muscle building high.

To keep fat gain under control and my cardio engine healthy, I'm experimenting with:

* **Rowing** --- short, easy sessions after lifting.
* **Rucking** --- starting light and gradually adding load/time.

I'll run another DEXA mid-August and report back.
