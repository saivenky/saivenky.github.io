Obsession and stubbornness go hand in hand. After about 36 gnarly hours of obsessing about a problem at work, I'm finally about to sleep with some peace of mind.

I seem to have two forms in which my obsessive behavior crops up:

1. Trying out new things: I'll read, hear, or watch videos about something new. If that topic sparks some intrigue, then I'll consume more content about the topic for several days or up to a week or two.
2. Solving a problem: This happens more often when I'm coding, but there's a certain standard of "solved" before I'm satisfied with a solution. Until I reach that, I can't stop thinking about the problem.

The solving the problem form of this has been more deleterious to my health.
