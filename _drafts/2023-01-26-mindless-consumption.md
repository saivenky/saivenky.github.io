Getting into a habit of mindless consumption is easy nowadays. Social media and tech companies have made it as easy as possible to get a dopamine hit.

I want to challenge myself to counteract this consumption habit with a creation habit. What if for everything that I consumed, I need to create something too?

The simplest implementation of this is behaving like a critic or reviewer. For example, if I watch a movie, then I need to review it.

This has two effects:

1.  Practice creating things: I’ve been talking about wanting to get practice writing content. This would facilitate with that goal.
    
2.  Reduce mindless consumption: If I know I’m going to write something about what I’m consuming, then I need to pay more attention. I’ll need to be a bit more engaged or a bit more active when consuming.
    
    Another effect is that I may need to be critical of what I consume in the first place. If I know there is a higher cost to consuming content (i.e. in addition to time consuming, I need to spend time and energy creating something), then I hope I’ll be more selective about what I watch.

### In Practice

There are two main things I mindlessly consume: 1) Movies or TV shows, 2) YouTube videos. Both are TV-related.

I have a habit of sitting on our couch for every meal. I eat in front of the TV. There's very little reason for us to get a dinner table because we would never use it.
