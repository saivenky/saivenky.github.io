Forcing myself to write is certainly a new experience. Although it might be similar to coding and work, in the sense that inspiration and motivation surge at unexpected times and often after rest. The times I’ve found the most inspiration and motivation are when I’ve been thinking about a problem for many hours or days.

I often form a thought, but then ruminate and mull it over in my head for a while. I will follow-up by learning more about sub-topics or questions I have related to that idea, usually in the form of YouTube videos. This helps me refine my thoughts further.

Through this process, there’s a rising sense of knowing what to do next and noticing that it’s only in my head, I have motivation to go and do something about it.

However, in this attempt to write 500 words a day, I’ve already gotten out all my thoughts in the first few days. The well of thoughts is going dry. I’m also not ruminating on the same thought or idea for multiple days because I’m getting them out faster than I am coming up with them.

One of two things will probably happen next: 1) I lose motivation to continue writing, 2) I start writing out unfiltered thoughts.

The latter of those has been referred to as monkey mind. And also sometimes just a way to write. I suspect it isn’t very useful. But this might be similar to a warmup or just an exercise that keeps the wheels turning and that part of my brain used to thinking and being activated.

The problem is dealing with the former of those two outcomes. Especially since I have an “obsessive” personality, I only do things in short bursts but with intensity. Today only marks day 6 and that intensity is waning.

I suspect I’ll even start questioning whether this was a fruitful venture in the first place. Why am I doing this? Is this useful for me now? Will it be useful in the future? Does this match the type of person I want to be? I will likely justify not following this habit using answers to those questions.

But at the same time, I did not really consider those questions when I started this. It was mostly driven off of what I mentioned earlier, the obsession over ideas. In this case that idea was inspired by a [HackerNews post](https://www.fivehundredwordsaday.com/beta) about a tool someone built for writing and storing 500-words-a-day-style writings. The post accompanying it provided the context and initial spark of motivation.

Since I skimmed the article, and going back it now, I had failed to notice that they are talking about 500 words a day for 5 days a week. I wonder how many times I’ve created loftier goals because I my inattention to details. I also wonder if that’s a good or bad thing.

And sadly, as I mentioned earlier, I’ll probably use the re-attention to detail, particularly the detail of “5 days a week” to not follow this goal over the weekend. But then again, that might not be such as bad idea considering I’m already talking about losing motivation.
