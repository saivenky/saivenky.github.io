I really want to improve my climbing. I’m jealous of people that started before me and progressing faster than me. I’ve been stuck in a V4-V5 plateau for nearly 4 years.

I thought I was being smart about training but I think I lack the consistency. And the key thing that I’ve been noticing in my 30s is training sustainably. Training hard and fast and then hurting myself is a recipe for being set back often and not making the progress I hope for. Rather, I really am trying to shift my focus into a marathon mindset.

This was already difficult because of my obsessive personality. It’s made worse by my observation of people getting better than me.

My perception of people surpassing me could also be a side effect of observing influencers, creators, or strong climbers at my local gym. All of these offer a curated and selective view of the world. But at the same time, I am my best self when I have competition or am inspired by people better than me.

Competition and bright peers was the reason I was so motivated to work harder in high school (and to a degree in college). Mental grit felt easier to develop. Although you can burn out, sleep deprivation never felt that much like a bad thing.

Physically, though, I feel much more vulnerable and prone to injuries. I can’t just work harder and power through. Especially not for climbing as far as I can tell.

I think the main issue is recovery. I don’t think my general habits are conducive to good recovery and fast growth.

Although I can train hard (not saying that I train as hard as I can right now), the rest of my lifestyle is fairly sedentary. I have a desk job where I sit 8 hours a day. After work I end up watching TV. Most days, I take my dogs out for a walk. Except for the days that I go climbing, which used to be twice a week, there’s not much more physical activity.

For recovery, I don’t do much except for literally not climb. That’s my rest. No active recovery or stretching or antagonist training.

My diet’s not terrible, but it’s not great either. I still have what I consider a lot of sugar in my diet and not enough fresh veggies and fruits. Even after looking up climber’s diets, there’s nothing special. [Reddit’s advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/8ezwft/nutrition_practices_people_actually_follow/) is basically “eat like an adult” and multiple commenters say that additional diet optimization beyond that is not really necessary until you’re at V12+.

So if it’s not diet, then it comes back to the actual activities I do: training and activities for recovery. Let’s assume that I end up with perfect training, what should I do for recovery?

A lot of this seems obvious, like sleep at normal hours. Stretch and work on flexibility. Stay active. Alex Puccio runs 3-4 miles 4-5 days of the week — although I am a bit wary of following exactly what she does because general opinion suggests that she overtrains. However, listening to other strong climbers at the gym (e.g. John “Broth”), they also have a lot of conditioning outside of climbing.

I’ve already attempting to improve general conditioning by walking more. Sadly I’m now one of those people that needs to track steps in order to make sure I have a certain base level of activity through the day. I’m already trying to make this one of the base fitness standards I hit on a daily basis for this year.
