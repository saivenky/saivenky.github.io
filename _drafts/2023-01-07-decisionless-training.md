One of the issues I have whenever I shift focus to working out, fitness, and training plans, is that my work suffers. My mind is too distracted by coming up with better plans and optimizations, that I lose focus at work.

To overcome this, I should reduce decision fatigue by making everything else in my life decision-less. There should be simplicity and rigidity in my training to the point that it's mindless.

There should be no question about whether or not to run today. It should be, "today is another day and I run everyday". I shouldn't have to wonder what my what I do for climbing. It should be, "today is Wednesday, which means density training".

The rest of my day should be structured via habits. Like "I walk every morning, while I walk, I listen to an audiobook".

These examples aren't completely random, some of these I want to do, but the details may look slightly different.
