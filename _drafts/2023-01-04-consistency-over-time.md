At work I talk a lot about consistency. At work, it feels like a more achievable task. Rather than use two difference technologies that do the same thing, be consistent and use one across the board.

Consistency itself has a few difference meanings, or rather ways it can be applied to a situation. When it comes to work, I use "consistency" in place of "simplicity". One tool is simpler than one (assuming each tool is of equal internal complexity). Being consistent in that sense means keeping things simple. Consistently use the same technology.

Consistency can also mean doing things the same way over time. When it comes to training, consistency is needed to achieve results. When it comes to habit formation, consistency is key to forming the habit.

The two forms of consistency I've gone over are consistency with regards to "what" and "when". Consistency with "what" means using one thing. Consistency with "when" means doing something over time.

Exploring this concept of consistency in other dimensions, is there a "how" and "where" consistency? It may be up to us to give meaning to consistency in those dimensions. I would also argue that "what" and "how" might be closely related. The object ("what") helps define the action ("how"). Is there any merit to consistency with "where"? I'm honestly not sure if there's a use for that, except for forming routines and habits, but even that relies on a time dimension.

Thought of another way, "when" is consistency (repeated patterns) within a temporal dimension. "Where" should then be repeated patterns within a spatial dimension. Reframing still doesn't help me come up with anything other than habits and routines. Let's skip ahead...

Consistency across time has been much harder for me. I love novelty and working on new things as my motivation waxes and wanes. I also have an obsessive personality. I get obsessed with things, ideas, etc (including TV shows or games), but for brief stints of time. I've never measured how long this obsession lasts, which I think would be a good exercise in gauging how long my motivation for something lasts.

Because I seek novelty and rely on obsession, being consistent over time is difficult.

Let's take this writing habit for example, I was tempted to skip out on it because there were competing interests. Honestly though, if I didn't waste as much time watching TV this evening, there wouldn't be a competition for time.

I need rewards and incentives to maintain consistency over time. Sadly, I think I'm also a person that can be motivated by something as simple as streak formation. Streak formation is a gamble though because breaking the streak can feel so bad that it feels impossible to get back on.

Journaling was one of those things. And I literally mean in a physical journal. I used to journal everyday. Then when I missed a few days, I made an exception where I can write my entry in the future, and I just make a note that this entry was me catching up in the future. Then eventually, those started to fall behind, and eventually catching up meant filling in entries for a week, then two weeks, and finally a month. After journaling pretty regularly in 2022, I ended up dropping it completely in around July.

The important part of streak formation is building checkpoints or recovery stations to get back on the habit train ahead of time. One idea from Matt D'Avella is not allowing two successive days of not doing something. One day = okay. But that means the second day, you must do the habit.

That's one particular implementation of recovery stations. My plan for this year is to allow journaling either in physical or digital forms. There were times when I was willing to journal, but that meant I needed to go to my desk and start writing.

Another recovery mode is via levels of success. For physical training, I'm hoping to set up a leveling system where I can hit my target but at various levels. As an example:

-   Level 1: Drink 3L of water. Eat fish oil.
-   Level 2: (Do L1 and also...) Walk 5K steps. Do 30 pushups.
-   Level 3: (Do L2 and also...)...

This way, even if I don't hit certain targets, I can always strive for level down. The goal is to track the average level over time and seek improvements that way.

Leveling might be the approach I take for journaling too in order to achieve consistency.
