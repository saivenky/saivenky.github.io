I want to get structured in my training. Its more fun to focus this planning in physical goals (like my want to be a better climber). Ideally I can come up with structure in skills development for other things like work, but that’s for later.

Climbing, more specifically bouldering, feels like a very hard system to come up with a training plan. Unlike pure strength training, like powerlifting, it feels like it is harder to come up with a good training plan for.

Currently, I’ve just been doing “medium” difficulty training sessions mostly because I haven’t figured out how to train yet. This is a good callout that I realized after reading “Strength and Power Sessions for Bouldering” by Steve Bechtel. In that post, he says:

> Many of us are stuck training “medium.” We train too frequently to really train hard, still being tired from the previous day’s training. That feeling of fatigue might feel right to some. It’s not. Life in the middle is rough…it’s too hard to recover and too easy to get you strong.

I’m still a bit confused about what he’s meaning to say in the second part of his paragraph:

> Think of it this way: getting your ass kicked on a problem doesn’t make you feel like you had a good session. Performing well on the rock makes you think you had a good session. Training should be performance directed.

“Training should be performance directed” - Yes, which means that if you had a bad session, you should figure out what to train, but perhaps not how hard you should train, right?

If you’re not doing well on a problem due to fatigue, then training harder is perhaps not what you want. You need to train smarter.

This is a bit of a tangent though, so let’s get back to the main issue: how do I train smarter? I keep thinking this is primarily an exercise of identifying the crucial skills for climbing and then training those. But what are those crucial skills? This isn’t a novel exercise though and so perhaps I should just stick to an existing training plan.

But as I look at sample training plans on the internet, one thing I realize is the complexity. As I write this, perhaps it just seems complex because I don’t understand the patterns within the plan. There’s likely complexity if you look at some of the training plans I come up with for myself.

Even as a I write that last sentence, I’m thinking “what training plans”. What have been my actual goals? Currently I do bench press because I like to do bench press. It’s a fun exercise. I don’t squat because it hurts my knees, but on occasion (not part of any plan), I squat because I recognize the value in having strong legs (or at least strong hips) for longevity and health later in life.

And then my climbing training is a haphazard mix of weighted pull-ups and just training sessions. I’ve been trying to use my no-hang to train fingers but more as an “increase frequency” training (the idea behind [Emil Abrahamson’s “Hangboard Training 2 Times Per Day For 30 Days” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE&ab_channel=EmilAbrahamsson)). Critique of this video include that this is not great for increasing finger strength since this finger tendons don’t gain strength that quickly (it’s very different from muscles) — this is what [Hooper’s Beta discusses in his response video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSSXW9Eq2Y&t=632s&ab_channel=Hooper%27sBeta). My motivation to use it would be to increase blood supply and promote recovery in the region. So it feels like another useful thing to incorporate into my training.

So summary so far it that my training plans mostly incorporate elements that feels good, backed partially by scientific evidence.

But in the end, the reason I want to get better at climbing is because I think it’s fun and feels good climbing. I’m imposing order and structure into something that started off as free-form and fun-driven. Don’t get me wrong, but I still find the exciting. As I’ve gotten better bouldering, I really enjoy the problem-solving and the struggle.

I’d like to document this journey to get better ideally in the form of a YouTube channel, which of currently been toying with the idea of naming “Road to V8”… or perhaps V10? Which kinda brought me back to the realistic goal-setting and planning questions around bouldering.
