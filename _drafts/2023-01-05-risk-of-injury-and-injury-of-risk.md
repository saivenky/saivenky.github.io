Injuries are annoying. Every time I have a minor injury or niggle, I can't help but think "if only I had...". Especially when it comes to an injury related to a workout or fitness plan I'm following. Then injury itself is a risk.

As I've gotten older, I've realized that the key to success is not winning the lottery (at least not for most people) and especially not sudden physical gains in strength. The key to physical fitness is sustainable, constant progress. I could repeat my philosophy of consistency, but I think here, we need more guidance.

You can easily make a lofty goal of doing a 3 mile run everyday. If you're already conditioned and have been a "runner", then this may be doable. If you're fit, but new to running, this may be an awful target. Even if you are able to follow this plan for 2 weeks straight, this is still terrible.

It's terrible because there's a high chance that it isn't sustainable. Especially if you're coming from zero running in the past. There's a high risk of injury due to lack of conditioning. Even if you're mentally strong and can push through pain, this is the type of pain and injury that will result in the type of injury where you'll be forced to take a break. Risk of injury is high.

But after injury, you still have risk. The risk now is related to progress. You can be a person that pushes through the pain, but that could prolong your recovery. Or you could rest until you're recovered. But how long of a rest is needed. There are unknowns that make recovery and return to progress difficult to estimate.

For example, today I tweaked my wrist while climbing. Let's suppose in a usual session, I'm able to give effort of 100. With my injury, let's say I decide to continue climbing. Because I didn't wait for my wrist to recover, my effort is now 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 for the next 5 sessions. Grand total of 250.

Now in an alternate universe, I decided to rest and not climb the next 2 sessions. Because I allowed time to heal, I could put out 80, 90, and 100 for effort. Grand total of 270.

Even though this is completely made up example, rest to recover paid off better in the long run. At the end of the "continue exercising with injury" scenario, I'm still at 60 effort by the final session.

The problem is this is a simplification with nice round numbers and a completely concocted example that attempts to show that resting is better. I can easily alter the number just a tiny bit that concludes the opposite.

There are unknowns about:

-   How much rest I should take
-   What is the effect of that rest?
-   How does training affect my injury?

In the worst case scenario, continuing to train prevents recovery or makes the injury worse. But if the goal is to get back to climbing as quickly as possible, I'm taking a gamble no matter what approach I take.

I also don't like that I'm forced to alter my training schedule. I have built-in rest days into weekly schedules. And for flexibility on when I work out, I may choose to take 1 or 2 days off before the next session. But that affects the rest of my life too. For example, I could choose to workout Saturday or Sunday. If I work out Saturday, then Sunday, I can go watch a movie with my wife. My wife has other plans on Saturday, so Sunday is the only day that works. But if I climb Sunday in order to get extra rest, then I'm forgoing spending time with my wife.

I don't enjoy making prioritization decisions like that. The injury has a cascading effect that bleeds into other parts of my life.

Injuries that prevent me from climbing (or even worse, working out at all) make me mildly depressed.
