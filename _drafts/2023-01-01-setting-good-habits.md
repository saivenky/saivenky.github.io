New years resolutions have me thinking about setting habits. So I'm writing about how I come up with good habits.

Key criteria to me are:

-   Easy to measure
-   Simple to track
-   Low effort

Easy to measure is important because there should not be ambiguity in whether or not you completed the habit. An example of a bad goal is "no unhealthy foods". This is very hard because the definition of "unhealthy" food is in question.

Ambiguity seems alright when you're very disciplined, but it is easy to stretch the boundary when you're desperate. You'll start justifying to yourself why someone is still within the goal you set for yourself even though your "disciplined" self would definitely disagree. Example, fruit cake is healthy, right? It has fruit.

So it's important to be very clear in how you are measuring a goal. I've considered defining "unhealthy" food as foods that contain added sugar. I use quotes around "unhealthy" because definitions vary - my definition may vary greatly from yours. However, it's easy to examples of unhealthy foods that don't match that definition. What about french fries? It's likely that added sugar is minimal, but clearly it's fried and too much salt. Same with chips.

In that case you could decide to expand the definition somehow to encapsulate all the exceptions. Now I will re-emphasize the "easy" part of "easy to measure". This ties in with the second criteria...

Simple to track is important because it is the friction that is unrelated to the habit that can still make you quit. Perhaps I came up with the perfect definition for "unhealthy" foods that has a three-part definition. Realize, that you'll need to mentally go through this checklist every time you're about to eat something. Three sounds simple initially, but days that you feel lazy, that'll feel like too much.

When you think something is simple, try to make it even simpler. Ideally, a goal should have a single checklist item to determine adherence. If you can't, you need to either change the measurement of the goal, or change the goal.

I think the goal "no unhealthy foods" is terrible because it's nearly impossible to come up with an easy measurement that is simple to track. A better goal might be, "no food with added sugars". Now the definition I suggested earlier has become the goal. Now it's easy to measure, and simple(r) to track. However, it is is a high effort goal. You need to spend time to figure out whether a food has added sugars.

Low effort is important because even if you think something is easy now, there will be a time when you're feeling lazy and it will feel hard. The goal needs to feel as easy as climbing a single stair case step. On its own, it feels too little, but with many more steps, you can climb up entire floors in a building.

"No food with added sugars" is still terrible for me because this is high effort considering I have a sweet tooth and have little discipline around sugary snacks and foods.

Unfortunately I don't have a good low effort goal for the direction I'm headed with this, and instead focused on a different health-related goal for myself, "drink â‰¥ 3L of water per day". If I really had to stick with my earlier example, I might say "don't buy, accept, or make foods with added sugar". With an "if in doubt, say no" clause. I still don't think it's simple to track or low effort though (or at least not to my satisfaction), which is why I know if I made it a goal, it has a high likelihood of failure.
