When I focus on too many things, certain parts of my life suffer. The three main things that I always come back to is sleep, fitness, work, and fun. It's interesting how as I wrote this, sleep ended up in its own section.

For example, I could argue that fitness, health, and sleep are all related and so I should've lumped sleep into fitness. However, there is a different feeling of accomplishment after a workout (what I consider fitness) versus sleep.

It seems like I have trouble balancing these four current pillars of my life. I haven't even mentioned family and relationships, which says something else about me, but let's come back to that later.

Technically I think there are a few other pillars. For example where does writing this current log entry come in? Or what about if I'm programming for fun? And some semesters, I'm taking a graduate class and so clearly school also must be a pillar during some parts of the year.

But essentially I think I can only focus on three. If I sleep after I finished writing, that means I'm prioritizing sleep over work. If I work, then I'm prioritizing work over sleep. Parts of my personal chores list are suffering because I haven't even listed that as a pillar here.

This isn't the first time I've had this realization. The problem is that this "spread too thin" feeling creeps up slowly. I have motivation to work on a certain pillar and so I start strong. But I'm implicitly reallocating time from one pillar to another. In this case, the new year has inspired me to write and focus on fitness more (typical... I know). But my likely choice to sleep is suggesting that I implicitly reallocated my work time to those.

Eventually, I think the solution to these issues is discipline. Clearly with more discipline, I can accomplish more in the day without sacrificing the "strength" of the pillars of focus. Perhaps the "fun" pillar doesn't need to be so big. But fun and discipline are very oppositional forces. And it is truly exhausting being so disciplined.

So rather than sacrifice, perhaps multi-tasking or better habits is key? For example, today I managed to prop up my laptop on the treadmill so I could walk and watch shows at the same time. Completely novel concept. I should probably patent that idea...

But walking on the treadmill is really general fitness and I still need to allocate time for climbing. Still, this does make me feel better because I'm getting my steps in, improving overall general fitness, but also letting me "have fun", or rather letting my brain just consume and not really have to actively participate.

I love the idea of discipline. But executing it is a challenge and I often need a reward to keep going. Essentially gamifying my adherence to my planning.

1.  Planning is fun
2.  Doing is hard
3.  Accomplishment is fun

My go-to method for gamifying is creating an RPG-style leveling system.
