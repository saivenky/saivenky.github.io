The posts written here are my thoughts and my thoughts alone. Regardless of the pronouns or qualifiers I used in these posts, there is an implicit "I think" that should be added to the beginning of each sentence I write.

When I say, something like "people that live in the city walk more", I'm actually saying "I think people that live in the city walk more".

Even if I link to an external resource, this is solely my interpretation of that work. And quite often, I skim other bodies of work, so I may completely misinterpret results too sometimes. I might even show blatant confirmation bias in my posts by only linking articles that support my viewpoint.

All in all, these posts are my random musings and thoughts. Some of them are completely unfiltered and there is no intent to offend anyone.
