This isn't the first time I've tried a blog. This a collection of links that I've discovered to earlier iterations.

* [American Tech Saiko](https://atsaiko.blogspot.com) (circa 2008): This was in college. I actually tried hosting a blog on my laptop too, but that data is lost now.
* [Only Slightly Better](https://onlyslightlybetter.blogspot.com) (circa 2011): Attempted refresh of the previous blog but with a new name. I always keep making new names. It just feels fresher that way.
* No name hosted originally on `<personal domain>/secret-blog` (circa 2016): I wanted to branch out beyond just programming during that time, but this was well into my engineering career.

Eventually, I'll port all of those posts over into this website.

Some of my older posts are very cringy, but for the sake of completion, I will include those (mostly unedited, but I'll end up editing some of the really cringy ones).
